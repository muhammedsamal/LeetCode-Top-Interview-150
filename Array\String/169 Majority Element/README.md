Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```
